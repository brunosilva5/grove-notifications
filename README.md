# grove-notifications

This repository implements a set of asynchronous tasks to automate some processes in our student house, nicknamed "GroveHouse". The main objective is to periodically and automatically notify residents of certain events, such as:
    - Notify about payments deadlines;
    - Notify about weekly rotating cleaning tasks;
    - etc...
The code is hosted on (Heroku)[www.heroku.com] and uses (SendGrid)[www.sendgrid.com] for email dispatchment.
