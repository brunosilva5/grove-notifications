## grove-notifications

This repository implements a set of asynchronous tasks to automate some processes in our student house, nicknamed **"GroveHouse"**. The main objective is to periodically and automatically notify residents of certain events, such as:
  * Notify about payments deadlines;
  * Notify about weekly rotating cleaning tasks;
  * etc...
    
The code is hosted on [Heroku](www.heroku.com) and uses [SendGrid](www.sendgrid.com) for email dispatchment.
